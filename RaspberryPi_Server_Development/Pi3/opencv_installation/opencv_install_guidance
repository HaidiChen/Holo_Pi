# Step 1: Install OpenCV dependencies
./opencv_dependencies.sh

# check your python version and install the 
# corresponding packages, 
sudo apt-get install python3.x-dev

# Step 2: Download the OpenCV source
./opencv_download.sh [opencv_version]

# Step 3: Setup Python environment
./opencv_python.sh

mkvirtualenv cv -p python3

# Step 4: Configuring and compiling OpenCV
# if you are not sure whether you are under the virtual environment
# type following command
workon cv

# otherwise, execute the following command directly
./opencv_compile.sh

# Step 5: Finish OpenCV installation
#
# In this step, find the cv2.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so file
# it should be under the path like this:
#
# /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-pakcages/
#
# and rename it as cv2.so, then link it to the following path:
#
# ~/.virtualenvs/cv/lib/python3.6(your own version)/site-packages/
#
# by using the commands below:
#
# cd ~/.virtualenvs/cv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/
# ln -s your-path-to-cv2.so-file cv2.so

# Step 6: Testing OpenCV installation
#
# enter the virtual environment (e.g. command 'workon cv')
# enter the interpreter of python
# import cv2 to see if any thing goes wrong
# if not, congratulations, OpenCV has been successfully
# installed on this machine
